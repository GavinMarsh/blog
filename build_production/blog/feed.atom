        <p>I talked to a developer last week who has been teaching kids to code in an after school program. </p>
<p>His teaching secret? </p>
<p>Teach using this format: <strong>Motivate &gt; Set a Goal &gt; Work through the problem together.</strong></p>
<h2>Keep It Simple &amp; Move Fast</h2>
<p>I think it's a helpful starting place when the big, scary idea of &quot;CODING&quot; seems intimidating.</p>
<p>Start by understanding <strong>what</strong> you want to change in the world and <strong>why.</strong> (Motivation!) </p>
<p>Set a concrete goal of a small feature / slice of an application that would solve a problem ‚Äî even if it's small and silly. (That's a goal!) </p>
<p>Then chip off a small piece of your day to work toward your achievable goal as quickly as possible. Rinse &amp; repeat.</p>
<p>It's not a bulletproof way to learn code. (I mean... Is there a &quot;right&quot; way to learn?) But, I think it's a useful framework for biting off a quick win when someone's just dipping their toes in the water.</p>    ]]></content>

<p>Fact: OKC‚Äôs Thunderplains Conference has altered the trajectory of my career in a massively positive way.</p>
<p>If you told me a year ago before my first time attending that it would lead to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting my dream job working at an OKC software startup</li>
<li>Meeting invaluable friends, mentors, and impressive makers through the local Techlahoma community</li>
<li>Amplifying my excitement for development, which would lead to massive personal growth (and happiness)</li>
</ol>
<p>I would‚Äôve had no idea. But I hope sharing my experience will encourage at least one person on the fence about jumping into local tech events to see what‚Äôs possible.</p>

<h2>1. I Learned to Always Say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to Public Speaking (Even When It‚Äôs Scary)</h2>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/jndc0TQq9fvK8" width="480" height="317" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Last year was the first time I really tried my hand at a ‚ÄúLightning Talk‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa quick, 5-minute presentation. Here‚Äôs the thing: I almost never actually feel like signing-up at the time, but I‚Äôm always glad when I do.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to sit down, stay quiet, and feel safe. Stepping out feels vulnerable.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm ridiculously glad after following through at Thunderplains the past two years. My split-second decision last year to rattle through a short talk on ‚ÄúMarketing Your Side Project on a Shoestring Budget‚Äù sparked an introduction with 3 Tailwind team members, which eventually lead to me joining the marketing team this May.</p>
<p>It just takes 5 minutes of bravery to open 5 months of new opportunities. Why not give it a shot?</p>
<p>Just focus on teaching one thing. Lightning talks don‚Äôt have to be crazy complicated to bring value. This year I simply broke down a few quick marketing and customer development lessons I‚Äôve gleaned from side projects and working alongside smart Tailwind folks.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Your ideas might seem painfully obvious to you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut this could be your audience‚Äòs first exposure to a game-changing idea.</p>
<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/r0G3UZqZk3sJ83" width="595" height="485" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
<p>Here‚Äôs the LONG version of the presentation I gave. I whittled it down to about 14 slides to rip through the bare essentials in 4 minutes and 59 seconds.</p>
<h2>2. I Made Time and Space to Get Friendly with Oklahoma City‚Äôs Tech Community</h2>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3ohhwgtTbYXLTssiek" width="480" height="271" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Twitter‚Äôs a valuable platform for connecting with makers in tech. LinkedIn makes keeping in touch with professional connections frictionless. However‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Something special happens when you bring all your community‚Äôs like-minded makers together.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm constantly running into smart, talented, generous people I met for the first time at last year‚Äôs conference.</p>
<p>Striking up conversations with the developers around me opened my eyes to a simple truth: These are real people just like me. We all want to make cool stuff that matters.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt underestimate how motivating this can be! I‚Äôm far more excited to jump into a local meetup now that I know a handful of people I can strike up an (only slightly awkward) conversation with.</p>
<h2>3. Excited Makers -&gt; Make You Excited</h2>
<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/yoJC2GnSClbPOkV0eA" width="480" height="401" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Almost every week I chat with someone I‚Äôve met from a conference‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it always pumps me up.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd be diving into marketing or software development if it weren‚Äôt for a crowd of talented, passionate people who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced me to new frameworks, communities, strategies, blog posts, podcasts, and courses</li>
<li>Gave feedback on my podcasts, videos, and side project ideas</li>
<li>Keep me accountable to actually ship work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhether it‚Äôs a blog post like this or a quick-and-dirty API.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Find people who get as excited as you do about creating impactful projects that make the world a better place. Surround yourself with them and stay in touch.</p>
<p>Last year I met Dale Spoonemore who shared his burning passion to create an app that could teach anyone to grow their own food in a backyard garden. Ambitious? Sure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut he did it.</p>
<p>Last year, Seed to Spoon was more-or-less an idea in its infancy. This year he stood on stage at the closing keynote to share his riveting journey to 60,000 app downloads.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OBI4743TTqEkL6hd9g91Pw.png" alt="Dale Speaking" /></p>
<p>Dale is walking proof that you can code the change you want to see in the world‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand that‚Äôs terrifically exciting.</p>

        <p>This week on¬†<a href="http://sixstarsonly.com/">Six Stars Only</a>¬†we're sharing the best 100% free resources we actually use to create videos that stand out from music to motion graphics.</p>
<p>Want to download all 22+ free resources in one easy cheat sheet? ‚û°¬†<a href="https://www.getdrip.com/forms/718284658/submissions/new">Just go here to access the checklist.</a></p>
<h3>Why should I use these free resources in my next¬†video?</h3>
<p>They'll help you create videos WAY faster than you could without them.¬†You'll save massive amounts of time by using the right templates as a jumping off point for your video projects. Seriously‚Ää---‚ÄäI used a chunk of these resources during the first week of my new job to crank out a video in record time. Bookmarking the templates and tools that work for you can pay off quickly.</p>
<p>It's also key to make sure you're not using TIRED templates.¬†You can tell when someone's applied an overused, boring, played-out template or piece of audio to their video. Avoid coming off as amateurish by using fresh templates and more original, customizable resources like the ones we're about to list.</p>
<p>It's easier than you think to bump up your production quality to blow past other creators.¬†I've personally used every single one of these resources‚Ää---‚Ääand they've absolutely helped me create better videos. It can feel tempting to just &quot;get something out there&quot; but your viewers will be able to see the difference when you apply a bit of discipline to bring in some polished audio, graphics, or other finishing touches.</p>
<h3>Free Stock Video &amp; Creation Tools (That Just¬†Work)</h3>
<p><a href="https://videos.pexels.com/">Pexels Videos</a>¬†is absolutely brilliant for high-quality, low-fuss stock video that's free to use business or personal use.</p>
<p><a href="https://spark.adobe.com/">Adobe Spark</a>¬†is a lightweight tool to create videos for social sharing that turn heads. The best part? It's insanely fast to use and easy for beginners to pick up.</p>
<p>I actually take an unconventional approach to using¬†<a href="https://giphy.com/">Giphy</a>. I'll use it to search for a reaction GIF, then use it's export to MP4 option to bring it into an existing video project.</p>
<p>Extra tech-savvy? Try the command-line tool¬†<a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a>¬†for no-nonsense video downloading.</p>
<h3>These Motion Graphics Templates for After Effects Will Make You¬†Smile</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.rocketstock.com/free-after-effects-templates/">Rocketstock</a>¬†is a perfect free After Effects template collection to get familiar with first. There's a good variety of useful titles, effects, and animated graphics here to add visual flair to your next project.</p>
<p>You should also check out the variety of free templates at¬†<a href="https://motionarray.com/browse/free?categories=free">Motion Array</a>.</p>
<h3>Use These Free Fonts &amp; Typography Pairings for More Polished¬†Videos</h3>
<p>It's tough to beat free, right?¬†<a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>¬†boasts a treasure trove of good-looking fonts.</p>
<p>It's a bit intimidating to pick the¬†<em>right</em>¬†fonts when you're new to typography. Enter¬†<a href="https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts">Typewolf.¬†</a>It's a brilliant little site that gives you a fresh, curated look at fonts in a way that's easy to understand.</p>
<p>Still not sure where to start with free fonts?</p>
<p>I would stick to one of these font-families in Google Fonts first and use it exclusively in your project in different boldness settings until you feel more adventurous.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Montserrat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato">Lato</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Free Tools to Pick a Non-Sucky Color¬†Scheme</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/chrome/">Colorzilla</a>¬†makes it dead simple to grab any color in your browser with this Google Chrome extension.</p>
<p>Find a curated color palette that you can pick-up and start using immediately with¬†<a href="https://www.webdesignrankings.com/resources/lolcolors/">LOL Colors</a>¬†and¬†<a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>.</p>
<p>Do you love how Gmail, YouTube, and Android's operating system look? Borrow from their color schemes with the¬†<a href="https://material.io/design/color/#tools-for-picking-colors">Google Material Design Color Picker</a>.</p>
<p>Can't find the perfect shade of a particular color? Get inspired by pro illustrators and designers by searching through¬†<a href="https://dribbble.com/colors/2516c7?percent=30">Dribbble Color Search</a>.</p>
<h3>Not a Designer? No Problem. Use These No-Cost Photo &amp; Design Resources Instead.</h3>
<p>Jake's go-to method for graphics in his YouTube videos is to Google the image he's looking for and take screenshots using a¬†<a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/making-fast-screen-captures-in-windows-and-mac/">keyboard command</a>. Easy peasy.</p>
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>¬†provides a hipster-friendly antidote to disastrously fake-looking stock photos. The search is pretty decent now too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>¬†pulls in free-to-use photos from a variety of sources and sports excellent search. I'll usually pull this out if Unsplash doesn't return the photos I need.</p>
<p><a href="http://thepatternlibrary.com/">The Pattern Library</a>¬†features free, off-the-wall designs you can use for backgrounds in your next project.¬†<a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/">Subtle Patterns</a>¬†will do the same thing‚Ää---‚Ääit's just toned down.</p>
<p><a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a>¬†rocks. Search for almost any word and get a simple black-and-white icon that communicates it. I use it often for simple projects and presentations. Just make sure you use proper attribution.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite hacks for quick, 100% icons that actually look good. Pop open¬†<a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=food&amp;style=flat&amp;price=free">Iconfinder</a>¬†and type in your search. Next, filter by &quot;Free&quot; and then &quot;Flat&quot;. Boom‚Ää---‚Ääinstant, slick-looking icons.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger">Steve Schoger</a>¬†is my designer hero. His top-notch collection of free patterns and icons includes¬†<a href="http://www.heropatterns.com/">Hero Patterns</a>,¬†<a href="http://www.heroicons.com/">Heroicons</a>,¬†<a href="http://www.zondicons.com/">Zondicons</a>.</p>
<p><em>Side-note: I'll often upgrade to a paid icon set for more custom client work. It makes it easy to customize icons by swapping out colors and making changes on the fly if you're comfortable with a program like Adobe Illustrator or Sketch.</em></p>
<h3>Dodge Mistakes and Confusing Language in Your¬†Writing</h3>
<p>Don't risk an embarrassing typo. Run all your text through¬†<a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>¬†to catch obvious (and sneaky) errors before you hit publish or finalize anything.</p>
<p>For longer copy like a script,¬†<a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a>¬†helps you identify and fix lengthy, complex sentences. It's super helpful during the editing process for your writing.</p>
<h3>Use Audio That Makes You Sound Like a Pro (on a Bootstrap Budget)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music">YouTube Creator Studio</a>¬†is the classic. It's a big library of decent audio tracks and effects that's a quick step up from the overplayed music bundled with something like iMovie or Adobe Premiere. It's easy to filter your music by duration, mood, or genre quickly too.</p>
<p><a href="https://wistia.com/library/music">Wistia's free music collection</a>¬†has become my hands-down favorite choice for short business videos. They're peppy and professional-sounding with no strings attached. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Want something more unique? Hop on¬†<a href="https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?q=hip%20hop&amp;filter.license=to_use_commercially">SoundCloud</a>¬†to search for a track with Creative Commons enabled. You can throw it in your video and add a title card at the end giving attribution to the creator. Everyone wins.</p>
<h3>Want to download all 22+ free resources in one easy cheat sheet? ‚û°¬†<a href="https://www.getdrip.com/forms/718284658/submissions/new">Just go here to access the checklist.</a></h3>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>Would you rather set your annual marketing budget or get a root canal?</p>
<p>If you're like me, it can almost feel like a toss-up. Not everyone gets a &quot;rush&quot; from swimming in spreadsheets and numbers‚Ää---‚Ääbut there's good news for the rest of us! You don't to have an accounting degree or fall in love with business finance to set a results-driven marketing budget that sets a clear path for sustainable growth.</p>
<p>In this post we're going to start with some practical questions, use a couple rules of thumb, avoid discounting of-the-wall channels, and tie everything together by basing our marketing spend off our revenue goal.</p>
<h3>1) Benchmark your revenue to start with the end in¬†mind</h3>
<p>It's critical to nail down an accurate picture of your business' revenue to set the right goals. If you overshoot (or underestimate) your actual numbers, any marketing goals you set will be on shaky ground.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing that you're going to need to check is just how much revenue that you're actually making. Make sure that you have a solid baseline for where you're at. So this will probably involve a conversation with the person that's most intimate with the numbers at your company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A solid revenue number can also provide a useful proxy to gauge your company's &quot;helpfulness.&quot; The way I see it: A business' goal is not to make money. It's actually to help people.</p>
<p>Making money is the byproduct of successfully helping people solve difficult, painful problems.</p>
<h3>2) Are you a scrappy upstart or an established contender?</h3>
<p>Your business is either attempting to gain a foothold in the market or maintain your existing position. Which categorizes your situation?</p>
<p>Established contenders typically boast a well-established customer base and long-running track record in their industries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These would be people who have been in the market for a while. People know what your name is. You are the entrenched competition. Not to say that you're the &quot;Death Star&quot; or anything but you've been around for a while.</p>
<p>You're not trying to introduce a new product. You're not trying to break into a new market. You're not trying to find your first customers. You already have customers that have been with you for months and years and however long and you're seeking to scale that system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do customers consistently recognize your brand or marketing before they talk to your team? From real estate to manufacturing, the reputations of dominant players tend to stick in their customers' minds, which makes it tough for newcomers to wrestle attention away.</p>
<p>But, what does a company in the &quot;scrappy upstart&quot; camp look like?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are when you're trying to break into a market you're trying to find new customers. You're trying to grow rapidly and really the goal there is is growth and finding new customers and getting your name out there so that people start to know who you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newer companies don't usually have the brand-name recognition, tsunami of traffic, and steady stream of leads that established players take for granted. Scrappy upstarts work overtime to discover new customers, spread awareness, and spin-up new processes on the fly to nurture leads.</p>
<h3>3) Use these rule-of-thumb metrics as a jumping-off point</h3>
<p>Every business is different. Context is king and the exact numbers you pick for your quarterly and annual marketing budget depend on your unique situation.</p>
<p>That being said... There are some commonly accepted rules of thumb that can help you with some back-of-the-envelope planning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are a new player looking for aggressive growth and trying to break into market between 12 percent and 20 percent is kind of the commonly used rule of thumb for how much you should be spending on your market and that's because you're rapidly growing. You're trying to build a brand and have people recognize you and you're trying to find the channels and scale the channels that are actually bringing you in the ads and customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply put, most businesses spend more aggressively while building their brand and finding sustainable sources for their ideal customers. It's not uncommon to see up to 20% of revenue reinvested into finding more customers for rapid scaling.</p>
<p>The story changes when you're evaluating budget as a larger, established company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First off, your budget is going to be bigger overall. So, it doesn't have to be quite as much of a percentage and you're an established player so you are maintaining your dominance rather than trying to you know sort of become king of the hill so to speak.</p>
<p>So you're really going to be spending more in the realm of 6 to 12 percent and that's because you're really focusing on systemized and what's working. Scaling what's working going deeper with customers and really maintaining those relationships rather than just crazy growth in most cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While scrappy upstarts play offense with their budgets, established contenders play defense. Established budgets seek to maintain deep relationships with customers and systemize what's already working rather than chasing down aggressive growth goals.</p>
<h3>4) Intentionally &quot;waste&quot; at least 10% of your marketing spend</h3>
<p>Conventional wisdom blindly dictates that easily measurable marketing channels like Facebook Ads should win out over hard-to-measure channels like podcasts. This idea falls flat for for one key reason: arbitrage.</p>
<p>As an advertising channel becomes simpler for every business to track their return on investment, it also becomes oversaturated, overused, and mind-numbingly average.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If something is perfectly measurable, let's say a Facebook Ad where you can clearly, exactly measure with very little ambiguity how much it costs to get someone to click, to become a lead, to become a customer, and how much their lifetime value is. That is, first off, awesome‚Ää---‚Ääbut also the downside of that is everyone else can do that too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pattern plays out again and again on repeat across marketing's recent history.</p>
<p>Remember when emails were novel, but hard to use? Customers were opening newsletters from businesses at 80%+. Fast-forward 10 years later and you're lucky to get 1 in 10 customers to actually pick your subject line out of the flaming catastrophe of their inbox.</p>
<p>But what if you had been¬†the first business to leverage email to grow your business?</p>
<p>Everyone would have told you, &quot;It'll never work. It's too difficult. How will you tell if it's working?&quot;. It would've been risky, but.... You would've won big-time.</p>
<p>Don't shy away entirely from up-and-coming marketing channels that feel murky, unclear, and difficult-to-track. Instead, set aside a slice of your budget to make calculated bets so you have a shot at leveraging the next &quot;email&quot;-like channel on the ground floor.</p>
<h3>5) Start from the bottom-up to set ROI-based goals grounded in¬†reality</h3>
<p>It's easy to take a flat percentage of revenue, throw some marketing channels on a spreadsheet, divide your big number a few times, then throw in the towel on your marketing budget.</p>
<p>The problem? This is a¬†terrible¬†strategy for actually ensuring your marketing budget and goals are directly tied to your revenue growth.</p>
<p>Instead, consider a bottom-up approach by starting with your revenue and sales goals. Once you understand how many sales you need to make, you can back your way up to specify how many leads you'll need to convert to make those sales.</p>
<p>Armed with reliable revenue, sales, and lead-generation goals‚Ää---‚Ääsetting goals for your website traffic and other marketing channels becomes dramatically more simple. If 1 in 10 strangers you tell about your product or service will become a lead, you simply need to 10x your lead generation goal to set your traffic benchmark.</p>
<p>Not too painful, right?</p>
<h3>Take Control Of Your Budget Once and For¬†All</h3>
<p>&quot;Budgeting&quot; doesn't inspire warm, fuzzy feelings of pure delight for most business owners. That doesn't mean you can't squeeze every ounce of value out of the process, though!</p>
<p>You're now armed with everything you need to rapidly estimate, refine, and set concrete goals around your marketing budget.</p>
<p>Even better, you'll have your own marketing &quot;mad-science&quot; experiment running on that 10% for hard-to-measure channels (that just might give you an undeniable edge over narrow-minded competitors.)</p>    ]]></content>

<p>Have you ever tried to drink from a fire hydrant?¬†</p>
<p>I haven't personally, but I think I caught a faint glimpse after attending --- not one --- but¬†<strong>two</strong>¬†back-to-back marketing conferences in Boston this year: Hypergrowth and Inbound.</p>
<p>My head is still spinning from dozens of high-impact speakers and connections, but I've distilled the most actionable, valuable insights into 25 bite-sized nuggets you can start leveraging today to grow your business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P.S. --- I also boiled down insights from ALL the sessions I attended into a 41-page master document. Want my raw, unfiltered notes?¬†<a href="https://go.mcmkt.com/inbound-2017-notes">Go grab 'em here for free.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>1) We're generally moving from high-touch sales to frictionless, self-serve sales with a try-before-you-buy focus.</h2>
<p>Consumers continue to grow more comfortable with educating¬†<strong>and</strong>¬†selling themselves without ever speaking with a human directly.</p>
<p>Modern buyers also expect to see value¬†<strong>before</strong>¬†they purchase so get used to offering free trials and proving your value through case studies.</p>
<h2>2) Modern sales teams should consider removing any possible barriers to your sales process to allow self-service when possible.¬†</h2>
<p>How many obstacles do your customers have to bypass before they can¬†<strong>actually</strong>¬†buy from you?</p>
<p>Hiding your pricing, requiring multiple sales calls to qualify the prospect, and forcing future customers to wait for your sales team to &quot;call them back&quot; have become unpalatable to buyers.</p>
<p>Don't just help your prospects self-educate themselves about your offerings through your website --- take the process a step further into the purchasing process if possible!</p>
<h2>3) Simplify your brand's promise down to a true, relevant, motivating, distinct idea that can be explained in 15 seconds, then 1 minute, then 5 minutes, then 15 minutes.</h2>
<p>Emotions help us avoid decision paralysis! Your brand carries more substance and power than you'd think at first. In fact, it's the world's collective emotional response to YOU.</p>
<p>Simplicity matters. Can you explain your brand's story in a handful of sentences that are attractive and emotionally compelling to convince them to pay attention to what you say next?</p>
<p>Finally, remember your &quot;buyer persona&quot; is a person. Yes, a real, breathing, complaining, fickle, often-admirable person whose feet occasionally hurt. Never stop thinking of your &quot;target&quot; as a person --- or else.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/build-brand-20-minutes.jpeg?width=784&amp;height=588&amp;name=build-brand-20-minutes.jpeg" alt="build-brand-20-minutes.jpeg" /></p>
<h2>4) Anchor your brand's story around a big shift</h2>
<p>For telling an effective selling and positioning story: Start by communicating a &quot;big shift&quot; that's happened in the world. In Andy Raskin's words, &quot;Start by naming the undeniable, relevant change in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Next, prove that the change will create winners and losers. Make it painfully clear that there's a tangible cost to sitting on the sidelines and doing nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, show the &quot;promised land&quot; of what's possible by using your customers' own words.</p>
<h2>5) Challenge marketing &quot;best practices&quot; just because everyone else is doing them.</h2>
<p>Stop and ask, &quot;How is cultural conditioning biasing me?&quot;</p>
<p>Marketing culture leads us to believe investments must be 100% measurable from day one. But... It often pays off to invest in &quot;hard to measure&quot; marketing channels.</p>
<p>For example, Moz's most popular content series, &quot;Whiteboard Fridays&quot; started out as their worst-performing blog post type of all time. However, their vision, forward momentum, and constant learning transformed it into a highly successful content investment!</p>
<p>Most marketers only consider SEO and PPC when they're jockeying to attract visitors from search. But what about these relevant (but often overlooked) search factors everyone in 2017 can consider?</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Images</li>
<li>Google Maps</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>SERP Features</li>
<li>Social and Shopping Sites such as Amazon, Facebook, &amp; Reddit</li>
</ul>
<h2>6) Successfully targeting high-intent SEO keywords is more impactful than lower rankings on high volume keywords.</h2>
<p>Want to boost sales and profit from search traffic? Stop focusing on just the volume of keywords --- pay closer attention to the searchers' intent too.</p>
<p>Here's a quick formula to evaluate keyword profitability:¬†<strong>Search Volume x Click-through rate x Revenue Per Visit = Revenue.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/search-value-formula.jpeg?width=784&amp;height=588&amp;name=search-value-formula.jpeg" alt="search-value-formula.jpeg" /></strong></p>
<h2>7) Stop writing emails that sound like they're from a &quot;business.&quot;</h2>
<p>People don't hate email; they hate¬†<em>stupid</em>¬†email.</p>
<p>Before you hit send, make sure your company's emails provide direct value to the right people at the right time --- just like a personal assistant.</p>
<p>Chief Marketing Officers in hyper-competitive industries like SaaS are reporting that emails that look like they're from a &quot;business&quot; (mostly meaning they're focused on the company's products and updates, rather than direct value for the audience) aren't working as well as they used to across the board for B2B marketing.</p>
<p>Content marketing and blogs? They're also struggling to find a firm footing in over-saturated verticals. They¬†<em>can absolutely</em>¬†still work, but it's tough when you're writing about the same things as your competitors in the same way¬†<strong>and</strong>¬†you're in a tech company.</p>
<h2>8) Want arbitrage? Leverage these marketing channels in 2017 for competitive industries.</h2>
<p>In hyper-competitive industries, VPs and CMOs consistently recommended these B2B strategies that are working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account-based marketing (or even carefully coordinated sales + marketing)</li>
<li>Personalized videos</li>
<li>Live chat using tools like Drift or Intercom</li>
<li>LinkedIn Ads</li>
<li>Unified online/offline experiences</li>
<li>Self-hosted events and promotions</li>
</ul>
<h2>9) Inbound marketing may not work well for a small target market --- but Account-Based Marketing can close the gap.</h2>
<p>Enterprise and medium-size companies in particular have realized that focusing their marketing and sales effortles with laser-precision on only their ideal clients can pay off big-time!</p>
<p>It requires careful coordination and communication to pull off successfully, but the results defy expectation when it's executed well.</p>
<h2>10) Stop messaging people like a marketer and start helping like a personal assistant.</h2>
<p>Steer clear from self-promotional, low-value information blasts! If there's no clear value in every message you send your prospects and customers, re-evaluate your strategy.</p>
<p>Blasting useless information to your contact list is a surefire way to plummet your engagement and sink your brand's credibility.</p>
<p>Instead, start talking like your contact's intelligent personal assistant by sending the right content to reinforce your product's value at the right time in the right amount.</p>
<p>11) Every time you change your product/service your definition of success and customer onboarding should change too.</p>
<p>Why? Onboarding is the one thing¬†<strong>every</strong>¬†customer is guaranteed to do and it pays off in lifetime value and ROI. ¬†</p>
<p>Establishing rock-solid alignment and preventing confusion down the road will directly boost your customer retention. Don't be afraid to reinvent your onboarding. The alternative will cost you!</p>
<h2>12) Orchestrate account-based marketing plays as a carefully coordinated sales and marketing team.</h2>
<p>5.4 people per account are involved in standard B2B buying decisions. That's another reason Account-Based Marketing, which targets stakeholders at every relevant role, continue to gain traction.</p>
<p>Want to land your biggest deal ever? Your sales and marketing teams can work together to reach out to multiple decision-makers across your targeted companies at the same time --- but expect a significant learning curve to get it right.</p>
<h2>13) Build your sales and marketing team from the top of the funnel first.</h2>
<p>Want to build a sustainable growth team? Cybereason's CMO,¬†<a href="https://www.mikevolpe.com/">Mike Volpe</a>, thinks most companies over-hire on their sales team too quickly.</p>
<p>Instead, he recommends growing your marketing team first to attract, nurture, and convert a steady stream of leads. This allows companies to consistently attract more leads and avoid an overly narrow focus on sales.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-team-org-size.jpeg?width=784&amp;height=588&amp;name=marketing-team-org-size.jpeg" alt="marketing-team-org-size.jpeg" /></p>
<h2>14) Get serious about your &quot;culture code.&quot;</h2>
<p>Your company can scale decision-making faster and spread ownership when every individual on your team knows and acts on your mission statement and core values.</p>
<p>Remember: Your product doesn't drive success by itself. It's actually your people that care about the problem and make-or-break customer experiences.</p>
<h2>15) Create a clear, healthy &quot;balance of blame&quot; between your customer success, sales, and marketing roles.</h2>
<p>Your growth team isn't just in charge of growing revenue, they own the entire customer journey!</p>
<p>Every member of your team across customer success, marketing, and sales needs to know their role and take radical ownership over it. This also means setting clear expectations and goals between teams.</p>
<p>Set up checks and balances between teams to ensure your business grows with minimal stress. (Example: Customer success can help salespeople from &quot;overpromising,&quot; which will keep happier, better-qualified customers around longer!)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/building-a-growth-team.jpeg?width=784&amp;height=588&amp;name=building-a-growth-team.jpeg" alt="building-a-growth-team.jpeg" /></p>
<h2>16) Hire marketers who are analytical truth seekers, lifelong learners, and t-shaped generalized specialists.</h2>
<p>What traits should you keep top-of-mind when you're hiring marketers? For starters, look for people who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivated by metrics</li>
<li>Analytical truth-seekers</li>
<li>Coachable</li>
<li>Lifelong learners</li>
<li>Building T-shaped experience --- meaning they have a broad understanding of the fundamentals, but specialize in a couple key skills</li>
</ul>
<h2>17) Reshape your sales process to let the automation take care of the things that people shouldn't be doing.¬†</h2>
<p>Humans are better than machines at nurturing authentic relationships. However, machines will always win when it comes to raw consistency and reliability.</p>
<p>Why not benefit from both?</p>
<p>Use automation tools and CRM workflows to follow-up consistently, provide general education about your offerings, and pre-qualify sales leads.</p>
<p>This frees your best salespeople to truly shine by giving undivided attention and value in every interaction with the most qualified prospects.</p>
<h2>18) You can increase your prices by about 20% when you're seen as an expert.</h2>
<p>Just stop to think about this for a second.</p>
<p>Adding an additional 20% to the ticket price of your product or service results in a MASSIVE difference to your profit margin.¬†It's much more efficient to boost your profit than your revenue --- so why wouldn't you?</p>
<p>Carving out a niche in your space that you can dominate as the undisputed industry leader is critical, which is why you should....</p>
<h2>19) Invest heavily in these two types of content to become a master of your community.</h2>
<p>Scott Meyer from¬†<a href="https://9clouds.com/">9Clouds</a>¬†reports remarkable success in two primary content types for establishing yourself as an industry expert: original research and video courses.</p>
<p>To create original research, send out a survey to a key group in your industry asking about a relevant --- but hard-to-measure --- trend or behavior. You can compile your survey findings as a &quot;State of the Union&quot; report for your niche. Rinse and repeat this process to build your mastery over time and become a source of unique insights.</p>
<p>Video courses provide an excellent format for educational video that aligns with your best work too. Scott recommends creating a mini-course for every core offering your business provides.</p>
<p>It's a win-win since your prospects educate and sell themselves on your product or service --- and they benefit from your hard-won experience. Of course, the courses also position your team as domain experts yet again.</p>
<h2>20) Strive to find &quot;competition-free&quot; content in your industry whenever possible.</h2>
<p>Don't make your content marketing unnecessarily difficult by rehashing the same topics as your competition in the same, tired ways.</p>
<p>Instead, try to think, &quot;What is¬†<strong>no one else</strong>¬†talking about in my industry?&quot;</p>
<p>Your readers (and organic search traffic) will thank you.</p>
<h2>21) Fill your marketing calendar with 10x ideas, not 10% ideas.</h2>
<p>Coschedule's founder¬†<a href="https://coschedule.com/blog/author/moon/">Garrett Moon</a>¬†advocates making two lists of ideas for your marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas to grow by 10%</li>
<li>Ideas to grow by 10X</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are your only two options! Forcing yourself to intentionally distinguish between marginal improvements and massive¬†<a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/moonshots-matter-heres-how-to-make-them-happen/">moonshot ideas</a>¬†every 3-6 months will train you to identify an entirely different class of growth opportunities.</p>
<h2>22) Create a &quot;content standard&quot; and hit it every time to publish the BEST content in your industry.</h2>
<p>Don't you want your blog posts to be the¬†<strong>best</strong>¬†your audience has ever seen on the subject?</p>
<p>Coschedule settled on the following standards for every blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stick to a core topic</li>
<li>Define a powerful keyword</li>
<li>Back it up with research</li>
<li>Make it comprehensive and actionable</li>
<li>Always optimized with a single call to action</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, write down your &quot;content core.&quot; Simply put, it's the overlap between what your audience cares about and the unique value you provide as a business.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hubfs/contentCore.jpeg" alt="contentCore" /></p>
<h2>23) Leverage educational video throughout your marketing and sales funnel for a higher return-on-information.</h2>
<p>Why are videos so powerful? We process text in our short term memory, but visuals in our long-term.</p>
<p>Vidyard's VP of Marketing, Tyler Lessard, argues this means video has a much higher¬†<strong>return-on-information</strong>.</p>
<p>So, start using video liberally across the buyer's journey for storytelling, emotion, education, and building trust. A few types to get started include:</p>
<p><strong>Top of the Funnel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thought Leadership</li>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>Webinars</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Middle of the Funnel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product Demos</li>
<li>Competitive Comparisons</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Funnel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Culture Videos</li>
<li>Personal Sales Outreach</li>
</ul>
<h2>24) Need instant website results? Start by changing your value propositions and call-to-actions.</h2>
<p>One of the easiest ways to squeeze better results out of your current website is to re-evaluate your value proposition and call-to-action on every page.</p>
<p>Derrick Weiss from Impact puts it this way, &quot;Align your CTA copy with your value proposition! Your value proposition should be short and sweet, and offer your personas a strong way to fix their problems and combat their fears.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a simple, but powerful fix. Ensure your messages on every page speak directly to your customer's fears and problems, then give them clear next steps to solve them!</p>
<h2>25) Analyzing your website visitors passively using tools like heat maps produces higher quality insights.</h2>
<p>Why?¬†<a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/author/justin-rondeau-2/">Justin Rondeau</a>¬†from DigitalMarketer argues there's a big difference between what a user¬†<em>says</em>¬†and what they¬†<em>actually do</em>.</p>
<p>Often, user behavior in the real-world looks different than they'd expect if you asked them point-blank.</p>
<p>Start using a tool like¬†<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a>¬†or¬†<a href="https://www.fullstory.com/">Fullstory</a>¬†to learn the following for constant website improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>What stands out to visitors (and what doesn't)</li>
<li>Where visitors are scrolling</li>
<li>How long it takes for visitors to click content</li>
<li>Granular data on how different source traffic behaves</li>
<li>Points of frustration on key pages</li>
<li>Your visitor's &quot;journey&quot; on each page</li>
<li>Why are visitors not completing your forms?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/heatmap-justin.jpeg?width=784&amp;height=588&amp;name=heatmap-justin.jpeg" alt="heatmap-justin.jpeg" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whew --- did you get all that?</p>
<p>It's okay. I'm still digesting all this information too (and a ton more.)</p>

<p>Do you know which marketing channels made you the most money yesterday¬†(or last week, or last month)?</p>
<p>I remember feeling completely disoriented and overwhelmed the first time I opened¬†Google Analytics,¬†hoping to answer these questions for my own team. Graphs, panels¬†and¬†numbers all pop out,¬†demanding¬†your attention.¬†</p>
<p>&quot;How do I know ANY of these are the right numbers for me to¬†track in order to grow my website, attract new leads and sell to future customers?&quot;</p>
<p>If your business is like most, you don't need another tutorial¬†just about¬†another analytics tool.¬†</p>
<p><em>Real</em>¬†power lies in a clear, concrete tracking plan to determine your marketing return-on-investment¬†(ROI).¬†It answers the most valuable questions any marketing team can ask:¬†&quot;*Which channels made me the most money¬†---*<em>¬†and how can I get more out of them</em>?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>I'm going to lay out five best practices for implementing a solid ROI tracking plan for your business:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Identify one clear objective</li>
<li>Solidify the numbers that really matter</li>
<li>Map out your buyer's journey</li>
<li>Set up time-tested analytics tools</li>
<li>Create one source of truth</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/6%20Time-Tested%20Principles%20Feature.png?width=545&amp;name=6%20Time-Tested%20Principles%20Feature.png" alt="5 Time-Tested Principles to Flawlessly Track Your Digital Marketing ROI" title="6 Time-Tested Principles to Flawlessly Track Your Digital Marketing ROI" /></p>
<p><strong>Identify and¬†Set One Clear Objective:</strong></p>
<p>Setting multiple goals is a surefire strategy to befuddle your team. When it comes to goal-setting, an overwhelming mountain of systems are competing for your team's attention.</p>
<p>Google started measuring¬†<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-ranking-system-okr-2014-1">Objectives and Key Results</a><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-ranking-system-okr-2014-1">¬†</a><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-ranking-system-okr-2014-1">(</a><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/googles-ranking-system-okr-2014-1">OKRs)</a>¬†in their first year. SpaceX and Microsoft use a framework called Big Hairy Audacious Goals¬†(BHAGs) coined by authors Jim Collins and Jerry Poras in their bestselling book,¬†&quot;Built to Last.&quot;</p>
<p>And¬†<a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/goal-setting-strategies">the list¬†</a>rolls on!</p>
<p>The framework you¬†choose¬†isn't critical, but it's strongly recommended¬†your team rallies around one primary number to track above¬†others.¬†</p>
<p>Why? It's confusing and frustrating to spend precious time, money and effort achieving low-priority goals that don't produce results that truly grow your business.</p>
<p>If you're not careful, your team can waste time chasing¬†&quot;vanity metrics&quot; like page views instead of impactful numbers such as new customers.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/online%20tracking.jpg?width=294&amp;name=online%20tracking.jpg" alt="Focus your online tracking around one unmistakably clear goal!" title="Focus your online tracking around one unmistakably clear goal!" /></p>
<p><strong>Here's the bottom line:</strong>¬†Focus your¬†online tracking¬†around one unmistakably clear goal! Faulty communication and misalignment will kill your goals before they ever get off the ground.</p>
<p>More information isn't necessarily better. In fact, most of your data will distract you. It's your job to¬†identify¬†the signal in the noise.¬†Great ROI tracking starts by setting¬†one¬†clear objective and gathering accurate data you can trust from the right sources.¬†</p>
<p>So,¬†pick one big goal that will move the needle for your business:¬†</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it leads?¬†</li>
<li>Sign-ups?¬†</li>
<li>Demos?¬†</li>
<li>Email opt-ins?¬†</li>
</ul>
<p>Pick your number and¬†<em>stick to it</em>¬†above all others.¬†</p>
<p>Your team and future customers don't stand a chance if you're not 100% sure¬†what¬†key result you're hoping to gain¬†from your online marketing!</p>
<p>If you feel yourself starting to drift, simply start with the end in mind. What specific action do you want your future customers to take before they leave your website?¬†</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/action.jpg?width=294&amp;name=action.jpg" alt="What specific action do you want your future customers to take before they leave your website? " title="What specific action do you want your future customers to take before they leave your website? " /></p>
<p><strong>Three incredibly common website goals include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generating qualified leads¬†(Example: Filling out a form to schedule a free consultation.)</li>
<li>Generating sales¬†(Example: Purchasing a product from an e-commerce website.)</li>
<li>Providing customer support¬†(Example: Serving up the right help desk article to solve a frustrated customer's question.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we're primarily focused on marketing for this post, we'll assume you're going with qualified leads. Many of these principles transfer over to different objectives, though!</p>
<h2>Face the Facts by Solidifying These Linchpin Numbers</h2>
<p>Next, you'll want to list key numbers to track across your marketing efforts to measure your success.¬†</p>
<p>How well is your current activity fulfilling¬†the¬†primary objective your team just set? You won't know until you take a long, hard look at the numbers that matter most.</p>
<p>To make things simple, just focus on these three key metrics every week and month for your digital marketing when you're starting out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique website visitors.</strong>¬†Not page views! We care most about how many people we can reach, educate¬†and qualify if they're a great fit to work with.</li>
<li><strong>New qualified leads.</strong>¬†A site visitor can qualify themselves by filling out a form¬†---¬†or preferably,¬†several forms. You can also qualify leads by¬†their business attributes¬†(How much revenue? How many employees?), buyer persona¬†(Does this match our CEO¬†persona or our¬†marketing manager?) or engagement with your marketing(Do they like our Facebook posts, open our emails and keep coming back to the site?).</li>
<li><strong>New customers.¬†</strong>¬†Track purchases or new customers in your site's analytics if possible. Otherwise, use a CRM to track each lead's status as you conduct sales meetings, send emails and touch base with phone calls.¬†</li>
</ul>
<p>Pairing these three goals side-by-side enables you to clearly see where your digital marketing needs improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not enough unique visitors?¬†</strong>Revisit your strategy to attract new traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Too few qualified leads?</strong>¬†Take a closer look at your website's forms, call-to-actions and landing pages.</li>
<li><strong>Struggling to close leads into customers?</strong>¬†Sit down with your sales team to ensure you're communicating the status of new leads and passing along the right information.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/roadmap.png?width=487&amp;name=roadmap.png" alt="Map Out Your Buyer&#039;s Journey to Identify Gaps and Opportunities" title="Map Out Your Buyer&#039;s Journey to Identify Gaps and Opportunities" /></p>
<h2>Map Out Your Buyer's Journey to Identify Gaps and Opportunities</h2>
<p>As you're just starting out, it's helpful to visualize your future customer's journey¬†in purchasing¬†your product¬†---form the first time they hear your company's name to the moment they fork over their cold, hard cash.</p>
<p>It's called the buyer's journey and it quickly brings your most important metrics into focus.¬†For many businesses, the buyer's journey will shape the metrics you¬†choose: website visitors, contacts, leads and customers.</p>
<p>A buyer goes through three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Awareness: they are aware they have a problem that needs solving.</li>
<li>Consideration: they are researching how to solve their problem and who can help them.</li>
<li>Decision: they choose how to solve their problem and who they want help from.</li>
</ol>
<p>The image below represents the inbound methodology. The goal here is to map out a prospective buyer's journey through the entire process, keeing in mind the awareness, consideration, and decision stages:</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_7BD2F7EDF55B5ECF880BA9137F52222B5E2DB3BD75FB053BE04EA1B9CFDB42E7_1504273643901_static1.squarespace.png" alt="Mapping out the key action for each stage of your customer&#039;s buying journey makes your life 10x easier." title="Mapping out the key action for each stage of your customer&#039;s buying journey makes your life 10x easier." /></p>
<p>Mapping out the key actions across the inbound methodology for each stage of your customer's buying journey makes your life 10x easier.</p>
<p>Let's use¬†<a href="https://mcmkt.com/">McMahon Marketing's website</a>¬†as a quick example, buyer stage in parenthesis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stranger:</strong>¬†A marketing manager finds one of our blog posts through Google, a Facebook post or word-of-mouth that relates to a problem she experiences.¬†<strong>She clicks through to the website.¬†</strong>(Awareness)</li>
<li><strong>Visitor:</strong>¬†She reads a couple of blog posts that help solve her marketing challenges. Then, she¬†<strong>clicks on a call-to-action</strong>¬†for a checklist offer to¬†<a href="https://go.mcmkt.com/inbound-marketing-checklist">&quot;</a><a href="https://go.mcmkt.com/inbound-marketing-checklist">Launch an Inbound Marketing Campaign.&quot;</a>¬†(Consideration)</li>
<li><strong>Lead:</strong>¬†She<strong>¬†fills out the form</strong>¬†on the landing page with her email¬†in order to¬†download the free checklist. She¬†views¬†her inbox over the next¬†three¬†weeks to¬†<strong>open and click through a series of follow-up emails</strong>¬†which promote new, helpful¬†blogs and more advanced resources to¬†help¬†weigh the pros and cons of different marketing strategies. Finally, she¬†<strong>fills out the landing page form</strong>¬†to request a¬†free consultation. (Consideration)</li>
<li><strong>Customer:</strong>¬†After a coaching session to review her marketing results, she¬†explores¬†more case studies and resources like¬†<a href="https://go.mcmkt.com/agency-questions-checklist">&quot;7 Questions You Must Ask an Agency.&quot;</a>¬†She decides working with an inbound marketing agency makes sense for her business¬†---¬†so she requests and signs a contract. Her digital signature automatically¬†updates her contact and deal records in our CRM to¬†<strong>&quot;customer&quot;</strong> with the appropriate revenue.¬†**(Consideration + Decision)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we have a 1,000-foot view of our buyer's journey through the Inbound methodology. See how our website systematically leads visitors¬†in taking¬†the next step?</p>
<p>It's much easier to come up with a specific, testable idea for converting visitors-to-leads or leads-to-customers if you've mapped out where you currently stand.</p>
<p>Now, your turn. Try mapping out your buyer's journey. You may reach a step in your buyer's journey and realize there's nothing there!¬†Don't panic¬†---¬†just write it down and keep going until you get to the end of the journey.¬†Once you've done this you've either identified the gap(s) or identified that you've got a solid process!¬†</p>
<h2>Set Up These Must-Have Analytics Tools to Track Your Key Numbers¬†</h2>
<p>Now you know what events you'll need to measure throughout your buyer's journey.¬†So, how do you keep track?</p>
<p><strong><em>It's best to start simple at first.</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google_analytics.png?width=186&amp;name=google_analytics.png" alt="No website should skip Google Analytics for measuring visitors and tracking basic goals. " title="No website should skip Google Analytics for measuring visitors and tracking basic goals. " /></p>
<ul>
<li>No website should skip Google Analytics for measuring visitors and tracking basic goals. Get it installed¬†inevery page's header and¬†<a href="https://www.conversioner.com/blog/setup-goals-google-analytics-3-easy-steps">set up goals</a>¬†when your leads complete key events¬†like¬†completing a form, if possible.</li>
<li>To easily measure new leads and customers, use¬†<a href="https://blog.mcmkt.com/free-hubspot-tools-to-boost-marketing-and-sales">HubSpot's free marketing and CRM tools.</a>¬†It'll automatically record form submissions across your site and save each contact to¬†the¬†sales CRM where your team can update their status to¬†&quot;customer&quot; down the road.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>If you need some heavy-duty analytics for a mobile app or massive website</em></strong>, it's worth investigating some more advanced analytics tools:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Heap___Mobile_and_Web_Analytics.jpg?width=451&amp;name=Heap___Mobile_and_Web_Analytics.jpg" alt="Heap, Mixpanel, and Kissmetrics provide more data on how each user interacts with your site in order to boost conversions and increase customer retention." title="Heap, Mixpanel, and Kissmetrics provide more data on how each user interacts with your site in order to boost conversions and increase customer retention." /></p>

<p>![Peter Drucker wasn't kidding when he wrote, &quot;What gets measured gets managed.&quot;](<a href="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_7BD2F7EDF55B5ECF880BA9137F52222B5E2DB3BD75FB053BE04EA1B9CFDB42E7_1504560812576_drucker+quote.png">https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_7BD2F7EDF55B5ECF880BA9137F52222B5E2DB3BD75FB053BE04EA1B9CFDB42E7_1504560812576_drucker+quote.png</a> &quot;Peter Drucker wasn't kidding when he wrote, &quot;What gets measured gets managed.&quot;&quot;)</p>
<h2>Without a Single Source of Truth,¬†Your Marketing Team Will Hate You</h2>
<p>Peter Drucker wasn't kidding when he wrote,¬†&quot;What gets measured gets managed.&quot; If you expect a certain result, you must begin by inspecting and communicating that result.</p>
<p>I've never seen this spring up organically on a marketing team, though. You'll need a coordinated push to get started.</p>
<p>Your solution to cut through confusion and align the team?¬†<strong><em>Create one source of truth to measure your progress toward the one goal and handful of metrics that truly matter.</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/one%20source%20of%20truth.png?width=350&amp;name=one%20source%20of%20truth.png" alt="Create one source of truth to measure your progress toward the one goal and handful of metrics that truly matter." title="Create one source of truth to measure your progress toward the one goal and handful of metrics that truly matter." /></p>
<p>What do I mean by¬†&quot;source of truth?&quot; Simply put, all the reporting that matters should live in¬†one¬†place and stay brief as possible.¬†</p>
<p>If your reporting can't be boiled down to¬†a single¬†powerpoint slide, it's too much! You have a couple easy options to communicate your reports to the team reliably:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple spreadsheet or document</li>
<li>A reporting tool or dashboard¬†</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visibility is key with your goal-setting too.</strong>¬†You need to put this in a place where you can reference it easily andcommunicate progress to others in your organization.</p>
<p><strong>Choose simplicity over complexity.</strong>¬†A simple Google sheet is all most individuals will need at first. You can always add new systems as your business grows, but adding extra¬†&quot;features&quot; you don't need right away can actually slow you down.¬†</p>
<p>Of course, teams and marketing measurement masters can enjoy the benefits of dashboards, automated reports and more complex solutions.¬†</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/datawall_examples.jpg?width=450&amp;name=datawall_examples.jpg" alt="Databox provides a full-screen dashboard of your chosen data sources such as new leads in your CRM or Google Adwords campaign performance. " title="Databox provides a full-screen dashboard of your chosen data sources such as new leads in your CRM or Google Adwords campaign performance. " /></p>
<p>One much-loved choice for dashboards is¬†<a href="https://databox.com/">Databox</a>. This tool provides a full-screen dashboard of your chosen data sources such as new leads in your CRM or Google Adwords campaign performance.¬†</p>
<p>You can display real-time graphs on a spare monitor or TV in your office, but it'll send you daily and weekly notifications through emails and push notifications if you like.</p>
<p>Regular email reporting often provides the safest channel to keep teams in the loop, though.</p>
<p>If you've installed the free HubSpot marketing tools, you can set up email notifications every time a key form is completed and weekly/monthly dashboard summaries of your marketing efforts.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.mcmkt.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot_9_18_17__2_19_PM.jpg?width=450&amp;name=Screenshot_9_18_17__2_19_PM.jpg" alt="SumAll&#039;s premium reports provide an automatic overview for your social media in one place" title="SumAll&#039;s premium reports provide an automatic overview for your social media in one place" /></p>
<p>Need more insights for your social media accounts? I started using¬†<a href="https://premium.sumall.com/">SumAll Premium</a>¬†to send beautiful, automated overviews of everything from Facebook engagement to Google Analytics every week and month.</p>
<p>It's an easy way to keep our team in the loop on our social media growth without extra effort.¬†</p>
<h2>Ready to¬†Accelerate¬†Your¬†Growth¬†Goals?</h2>
<p>It's not a coincidence: world-class marketing and sales teams set measurable goals to clarify their purpose and direction. It aligns their team members into a formidable force.¬†</p>
<p>Suddenly, you'll stop grasping¬†in the dark at every¬†&quot;growth hack&quot; and new platform that drifts your way because you have a battle-tested system¬†for measuring¬†your team's true effectiveness.¬†</p>
<p>Facing the hard facts of your business may not come naturally¬†-¬†but it doesn't matter. You'll be permanently hooked when you realize the compounding effects of a team rallied around goal-based performance.¬†</p>
<p>Get started today and watch your team's steps toward¬†growth fall together like magic. It's just the beginning!</p>    ]]></content>

<p>Do you ever get the sneaking suspicion your marketing is under surveillance?¬†</p>
<p>You're absolutely right.</p>
<p>As you read these words, your competitors can leverage a massive assortment of tools to outpace your website's growth, copy your best ideas, and steal your audience's attention out from under your nose.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498188043842_spying.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>One question remains:¬†<em>Will you take action to develop more helpful, intelligent, and clever marketing to reach your customers better than the other guys?</em></p>
<p>Become a world-class marketing sleuth by using these 5 tools to understand what makes your competitors successful. Then, deploy new insights in your own marketing to catapult yourself ahead of the pack.</p>
<p>(Just click on any heading to explore each tool for yourself. Good luck!)</p>
<h2>1.¬†Deconstruct your Opponent's Technology Using <a href="https://builtwith.com/">BuiltWith</a></h2>
<p>Everyone wants to outperform the businesses that compete for your customers' attention, loyalty, and profits.¬†But, how will you pull ahead if you don't even understand¬†<em>what other companies in your industry are doing well?</em>¬†</p>
<p>BuiltWith provides a free, behind-the-scenes peek at the technologies that power any website you type into its search box.¬†</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498187753704_drift_com__Technology_Profile.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A quick search provides a high-level overview at how other online businesses track website visitors, manage their website content, and convert qualified leads.</p>
<p>As a result, you can speedily identify hidden tools that your competitors have been using to close deals¬†‚Äî¬†or uncover massive blind spots for technologies you can use that they've neglected.¬†</p>
<p>Checkmate.</p>
<p>I use their Google Chrome extension daily and I'm constantly spotting new marketing trends across different industries. I'll usually pick up a few tools I hadn't considered using too.</p>
<h2>2.¬†Identify Their Best Traffic Generating Keywords Using <a href="https://www.semrush.com/">SEMrush</a></h2>
<p>Undeniably, mastering your website's organic search rankings on Google can make or break your site's traffic.¬†</p>
<p>Don't you wish you could see¬†<em>exactly</em>¬†what Google sees in your competitors that it doesn't see on your site?¬†</p>
<p>Actually, you can.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498188223161_DxF051O4gs.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>SEMrush provides a powerful tool to understand which links are helping your competitors rank highly in Google and other search engines.¬†</p>
<p>For free, their domain overview tool provides a helpful bird's eye view of their organic search rankings.¬†You'll be able to quickly spot trends in backlinks and search keywords by digging further into the trial reports. Again, these cost you nothing.</p>
<p>Grab these insights on competitors and plug them into additional tools like¬†<a href="http://www.soovle.com/">Soolve</a>¬†and suddenly you have a rough content plan for blogs that compete for the same topic.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498188484167_neilpatel_com_-_Organic_Search_Positions.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Want to really get fancy?</p>
<p>The paid version can help you identify which backlinks and keywords your competitors are using to grow their traffic.¬†You can even pull a list of the top keywords that work well to grow your competitors' traffic and implement it in your own content plan.¬†</p>
<p>It would be nice to know that your next six months of blog content could go to edging out your competitor from the spot above you on the first page of Google, right?</p>
<p>To take these fresh keyword insights a step further, you should use Brian Dean's<a href="http://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique">¬†</a><a href="http://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique">&quot;</a><a href="http://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique">Skyscraper Technique&quot;</a>¬†to create a new piece of content that goes 10x more in-depth than their best-performing piece.¬†</p>
<p>That's how he got results like this impressive surge in backlinks.¬†Bravo, sir.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498188724471_ahrefs_referring_domains.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>(This means you can build on ideas that are already working for your competitors and leapfrog their efforts... if you're willing to put in the work.)</p>
<h2>3.¬†Leverage Facebook Insights to Fuel Your <a href="/social-media-audit">Social Media Swipe File</a></h2>
<p>Creating social media posts for your business can feel scattershot¬†‚Äî¬†or even pointless at times.¬†</p>
<p>&quot;How can I go toe-to-toe with X Competitor when they have more resources/team members/experience than me?&quot;</p>
<p>It's simple: You'll copy their #1 performing post format and test it on your own page.¬†</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498189102003_facebook+tip+1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>But, how? Facebook actually includes an easy-to-use setting inside Facebook Insights called¬†&quot;Pages to Watch&quot; that enables you to see the posts from your competitors that are attracting the most likes, shares, and engagement that week.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498189211900__33__McMahon_Marketing.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This means you can freely harvest the feedback from post types, tone, imagery, and other trends to reverse-engineer what made each of your competitor's Facebook posts a winner.</p>
<p>Get it? Your social media competition can actually do some of your research in real-time for you¬†(if you're smart enough to look regularly.)</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498189298444__33__McMahon_Marketing.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once you've identified a strong-performing post type or format, lay out a practical plan to test a similar type of post on your own Facebook page.</p>
<p>Of course, you should never copy a post's text and image verbatim¬†‚Äî¬†but you can draw heavy inspiration from the heavy hitters and each post your own original spin.</p>
<h2>4. Fire Up¬†<a href="http://neilpatel.com/seo-analyzer/">Neil Patel's Free SEO Analyzer</a>¬†to Punch-Up Your On-Page SEO</h2>
<p>Header tags? Meta descriptions? Page load times?¬†Optimizing your website to rank higher on Google can feel like a confusing chore that you never win.</p>
<p>Even worse, what if your competitor has checked all the right boxes in Google's eyes and has eclipsed your site's standing?¬†</p>
<p>It would be a wise use of your time to perform a quick check.</p>
<p>Fortunately, several free SEO analysis tools can provide a sharp look your own website and compare its standing against your top competitors.¬†</p>
<p>One of my favorite places to start is with Neil Patel's SEO analysis tool.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498189364324_Check_Your_Websites_SEO__Free_Analysis_Tool.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It's a snap to use and can provide a benchmark to see how your site's on-page SEO stacks up against local and national industry leaders.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498189419490_mcmkt_com___SEO_Analyzer.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The no-cost report will also identify major red flags with page load time, header tags, and other criteria that Google judges harshly.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498189399148_mcmkt_com___SEO_Analyzer.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This tool won't provide a 360-degree view of the many in-depth factors that a comprehensive SEO audit requires, but it's a low-hanging fruit that anyone can explore in seconds.</p>
<h2>5.¬†Decode Their All-Time Content Marketing Hits with <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/">Buzzsumo</a></h2>
<p>Want to see your competitor's most talked about piece of content?¬†</p>
<p>Buzzsumo makes it ridiculously simple to see the most shared blog posts, infographics, or videos your competition has published.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498189596975_instagram_marketing_-_Most_Shared_Content.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The site's free tool can provide two major clues to inform your content strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your competition's most-talked about content on social media.</li>
<li>A specific topic's most engaging content shared on social media.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may be wondering how you can put these two types of intelligence to work for your content.</p>
<p>First, take note of topics and formats that appear to have performed much stronger than usual.¬†It's critical to develop a nose for the trends and topics that produce better than average results on social media.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_D76EB7D2B27288843E1164A7E99A1860F7C2BB593D2F38575D90361B35CAC6CA_1498189814776_marketing_automation_-_Most_Shared_Content.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course, Facebook and Twitter engagement isn't a perfect measurement of a piece of content's influence¬†‚Äî¬†but it's a fairly reliable measure of audience interest.¬†It shows the topic can evoke a pointed emotional response from readers, which may help you choose more relevant topics for your own marketing.¬†</p>
<p>The paid version of Buzzsumo can also allow you to reach out to the same individuals that loved your competitors' content enough to share it.¬†</p>
<p>This is a huge benefit for when you decide to share your painstakingly created content with people who will care. If they've shared similar blogs and videos in the past, they're more likely to do it again.</p>
<h2>Now You Know... Ready to Take Action?</h2>
<p>Sit back. Relax. Crack a smile.¬†You've taken your first steps into piercing the mysterious fog that surrounds your competition's website to understand what makes their marketing tick.</p>
<p>Now, you can renew your efforts with increased focus knowing that you've identified major areas to outperform their traffic generation, SEO-rankings, and content creation.</p>
<p>You've taken an up-close look at the best tools to spy on any website's marketing and sales efforts.¬†</p>
<p><em>How will you use these tactics to keep a vigilant eye on your competitors and industry?</em></p>    ]]></content>

        <h2>How should you research keywords to rank your video for more views?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use Youtube suggest to find long tail keywords (and use &quot;_&quot; character to find words BEFORE.</li>
<li>TubeBuddy for competitor tag research</li>
<li>Tubular Labs for competitive research</li>
<li>YTCockpit shows avg video length for given keyword. Helps you avoid keywords with a packed 1st page of high-quality videos.</li>
<li>Best = YouTube Analytics. Analytics &gt; Traffic Sources &gt; YouTube Search</li>
</ul>
<h2>Major Key: Total watch time = YouTube's #1 ranking factor.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create LONG videos to maximize your watch time.</li>
<li>This will pay off across the board over time since it's a core metric Google uses to determine your video's value.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Audience retention (the % of your video watched) is also key.</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first 15 seconds of your video are critical. Nail your hook at all costs.</li>
<li>Use 1-2 pattern interrupts per video to avoid losing your audience's attention.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why you shouldn't overlook session watch time.</h2>
<ul>
<li>YouTube rewards videos that keep people on their platform.</li>
<li>Use playlists to increase bulk watching. Keyword optimize them so they rank.</li>
<li>Include links to other videos and your channel on your video end screen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create raving fans with these user engagement rules of thumb.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Give viewers a simple, specific option to successfully prompt comments. Don't make them think!</li>
<li>Add a clear &quot;Subscribe&quot; call-to-action to your script.</li>
<li>Reply to every comment in the first 24 hours after uploading.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a video title that scores clicks in 2 simple steps.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Step #1: Include your target keyword</li>
<li>Step #2: Maximize click-through-rate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why video descriptions matter more than you thought.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most people overlook this ‚Äî but you should write 200+ word descriptions for every video.</li>
<li>Descriptions give YouTube more data to work with and increases the likelihood of showing up in suggestions.</li>
<li>The first 125 characters of your description will appear in suggestions. Make them attention-grabbing to support your title's click-through rate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>But, how should I handle video tags?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pick 5-ish that make sense.</li>
<li>Use your target keyword as one.</li>
<li>Honestly, they're not as important as they used to be.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quick wins that will boost your rankings.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Say your target keyword 1-2 times in each video</li>
<li>Upload a transcript using a service like <a href="https://www.rev.com/">Rev.com</a>.</li>
<li>Always use a custom thumbnail to boost CTR.</li>
<li>Use a simple slogan so viewers understand your channel's purpose at a glance. Feature it in your about page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a channel trailer that answers these essential questions to convert new subscribers.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Who are you?</li>
<li>Why should I care?</li>
<li>What makes your channel unique?</li>
<li>Why should I subscribe?</li>

        <p>Do you ever get the feeling your social media efforts could be more effective, but you're not sure how?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globalwebindex.net/blog/internet-users-have-average-of-5-social-media-accounts">A recent study</a> revealed the average Internet user has more than 5 social media accounts. </p>
<p>It's not just everyday users that spread out their attention on social media, businesses do the same thing!</p>
<p>Facebook. Twitter. Snapchat. LinkedIn. Pinterest. The list of social media platforms your business can use to push its marketing forward seems to grow longer every year.</p>
<p>But which ones should you actually be using?</p>
<p>A social media audit can provide desperately needed clarity by helping you clearly evaluate which channels are growing your business and which ones are draining your time, energy, and money.</p>
<p>Now, you may hear the word &quot;audit&quot; and experience terrible flashbacks to last year's tax season. Don't worry! This process will be much different (and less painful.)</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not a big numbers fan. But I have good news: you don't have to spend hours of time or crunch endless spreadsheets of numbers.</p>
<p>By focusing on only the most important metrics, we can efficiently prune out the social media channels you should toss and which ones you should pour resources into moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the 4-step game plan to knock out your social media audit.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the right numbers: List all your social media profiles and note the most relevant numbers including follower, engagement, and clicks.</li>
<li>Measure with your gut: Evaluate your overall performance to judge the health of each social account.</li>
<li>Prioritize: Separate the winning channels from the losers.</li>
<li>Plan: Create 2-3 hypotheses that will guide your actions moving forward.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Let's get started.  </p>
<h2>Step 1: Identify the right numbers</h2>
<h3>Take Inventory of All Your Profiles</h3>
<p>First, you need to list every social media platform you've used in the past. Even duplicate accounts or dusty old profiles you haven't used in years count toward this list.</p>
<p>You can jot these down anywhere, but it can save you time in the long run to store them in a tool like Google Sheets for future reference.</p>
<p>You can also find pre-made templates <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pALC-qW5LNWkCbKu1DPdpKTAFF1P8xWA2L30aPJe0N8/edit#gid=0">like this one</a> created by Buffer to save you the effort.</p>
<p>It's incredibly useful to record the most important information from your profiles as you go. Using a spreadsheet like the one linked above keeps things organized cleanly.</p>
<p><strong>Fill in your spreadsheet with the following categories:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>URL address</li>
<li>Profile username or handle</li>
<li>Follower count</li>
<li>Most recent activity</li>
<li>Post frequency</li>
<li>Average post engagement </li>
<li>Monthly Site Traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you've set up your spreadsheet, you should have something that looks like this.</p>
<p>Don't worry about all those blank lines. We'll fill them in shortly.</p>
<p>Next, let's hunt down your profiles across the web.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a list of the usual suspects you should track down for your organization.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Pinterest</li>
<li>Google+</li>
<li>Snapchat</li>
<li>Yelp</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, other social media platforms exist and your company could have created accounts on sites such as writing sites like Medium and Tumblr. </p>
<p>Companies in certain industries may also use sites tailored to their industry such as Houzz or Zillow in the real estate space.   </p>
<p>Do you want to take an additional step to catch stragglers that may have flown under the radar? Use Namechk to scan dozens of websites for a certain username at the same time. It will quickly tell you whether one of your usernames is taken on a popular site.</p>
<h3>Make sure your numbers match your goals</h3>
<p>You can get lost in endless numbers that muddy the water when it comes to social media reporting. </p>
<p>It's helpful to focus on 1-3 primary goals when measuring the effectiveness of a social account.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the goals I've found most helpful to measure when you're starting out.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Building an audience</li>
<li>Increasing your audience's engagement</li>
<li>Driving online traffic</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, it's simple to hunt down the right information for each platform with the right tools.</p>
<p>Simply Measured offers an assortment of <a href="http://simplymeasured.com/free-social-media-tools/">free tools</a> to request a free, quick report on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and a few other platforms.</p>
<p>Most platforms also feature analytics tucked away inside each account's settings. </p>
<p>For example, Facebook Insights provides a valuable breakdown of your top-performing posts and details about your audience's age, sex, and location.</p>
<p>Check your each channel's follower count and post reach to gauge how effectively you're raising awareness on a platform. </p>
<p>Next, look at the past 30 days of posts to gauge how much engagement a post receives on average.</p>
<p>Finally, take a peek under the hood of Google Analytics to see how much traffic your website has received from each social channel.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Measure with your gut</h2>
<p>Now, you have a big-picture overview of your social media performance by the numbers. Next, it's time for a more emotion-driven take.</p>
<h2>Gather your top 5 posts</h2>
<p>You could comb through every post on every platform, but doesn't that sound exhausting? Instead, we're only going to look at 5 our top performers.</p>
<p>Find the top 5 posts with the most reach, likes, comments, or shares. Take a screenshot using the &quot;Command + Shift + 4&quot; shortcut on a Mac. (For Windows users, opening the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots">Snipping Tools application</a> will allow you to do the same thing.)  </p>
<p>Save these top 5 post screenshots in a folder by platform or a word document for easy access.</p>
<h3>Run through best practices for your platform</h3>
<p>Check recommended benchmarks for post length, images, and hashtags for your platform. <a href="https://thinkbonfire.com/blog/social-media-best-practices-infographic/">This infographic</a> does a great job of breaking down the most relevant tips for your text, image, style, and action you want your followers to take next.</p>
<h3>Compare to the industry leaders</h3>
<p>Steve Jobs famously said, &quot;Good artists copy; great artists steal.&quot; You can apply the same concept to your social profiles.</p>
<p>Whether you're selling pool accessories or software subscriptions, you can learn from the excellent social media strategies of your industry's top-performers.</p>
<p>Of course, your goal isn't to copy each post as it exists. Instead, you should be looking for templates, styles, post types, and themes to inject with your own unique perspective.</p>
<p>Simply Measured recommends asking <a href="http://simplymeasured.com/blog/how-to-perform-an-internal-social-media-audit/">the following questions</a> while dissecting competitor profiles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Branding: What is their overall image or theme? How do they portray themselves? How do they portray the brand or industry?</p>
<p>Engagement: What$)A!/s their engagement rate? Is it higher or lower than your brand!/s?</p>
<p>Frequency: How often do they post? Do they use multiple channels?</p>
<p>Popularity: How many followers/Likes does the brand or influencer have?</p>
<p>Types of Posts: What topics do they frequently discuss and how do the posts perform?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To quickly find successful pages in your industry, first go to Facebook's search bar and enter in a broad keyword. </p>
<p>For example, enter &quot;Pool&quot; to find pages in the swimming pool and hot tub space. </p>
<p>Keep scrolling past the local results and find results with follower counts in the thousands. Make sure the page remains active and posts regularly.</p>
<p>If the page matches all the criteria above, scroll through the past 30 days of posts. Take bullet-point notes on the post types that received the most engagement and <em>why you think it worked.</em> </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Wefixuglypools">WeFixUglyPools.com</a> Facebook Page reeled-in respectable engagement by giving away 2016's trendy Christmas toy: Hatchimals. </p>
<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FWefixuglypools%2Fposts%2F1180848868635738&amp;width=500" width="500" height="695" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<p>Can you see all the post types this page used to promote the giveaway? At a glance, I see live and recorded video, photos, and even plain text. </p>
<p>Clearly, it worked. The post above by itself attracted 212 likes, 152 comments, and 377 shares as I'm writing this.</p>
<p>If I were a small business owner in 2017, I would certainly take note of the social media giveaway as a strategy to keep up my sleeve based on this example.</p>
<p>Are you still having trouble finding great examples of posts? Here's a handful of high-performing pages almost any industry can learn from.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/netflixus">Netflix</a> nails their a savvy, natural feel with every post.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/shopify">Shopify</a> provides a great example of a page that mainly drives traffic while also keeping engagement high.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bufferapp/">Buffer</a> always experiments with new formats and works in beautiful posts that aren't <em>only</em> about their products.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Starbucks/">Starbucks</a> knows how to put its products front-and-center without feeling stale.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're still hungry for a few more examples, see <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28441/The-15-Best-Facebook-Pages-You-ve-Ever-Seen">this round-up post</a> that Hubspot put together for inspiration.</p>
<h1>Step 3: Separate the winners from the losers</h1>
<p>It's time for you to make some quick decisions by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>. This is the principle that estimates 80% of your results will stem from 20% of your work.</p>
<p>The important question remains: how do you decide which 20% to focus on right now? It's finally the moment of truth.</p>
<h2>Rank each platform's effectiveness from 1 to 5</h2>
<p>Since you've gathered numbers and examples from your industry in the last two steps, it's time to rate your channels. Rate each platform's current effectiveness to meet your business goals from 1 (very ineffective) to 5 (very effective.)</p>
<p>Sort your freshly ranked profiles from highest to lowest. Next, break the profiles down into three buckets: &quot;Worst,&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; and &quot;Best.&quot;</p>
<h2>Eliminate the worst, Limit the Okay</h2>
<p>Right of the bat, you can identify low-value channels. These often share the same problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicating another profile</li>
<li>Low overall reach for each post</li>
<li>Painfully slow growth rate for new followers</li>
<li>Apathetic engagement with almost no likes, comments or shares</li>
<li>Channels that align poorly with your target audience</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, you should shutter any duplicates and accounts showing months of inactivity. But, what about the others? </p>
<p>It's tempting to test out new ideas on every platform. More attention in more places means more results, right? <strong>Not necessarily!</strong></p>
<p>Limitless possibilities exist to jumpstart and improve every &quot;Okay&quot; social profile. Still, it's a huge mistake to test them all out.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: <em>Your time is more limited than you think.</em></p>
<p>Rather than working yourself ragged on a dozen accounts, you're going to work smart by harnessing laser-focus on your channels with the best chance to succeed. Which means...</p>
<h3>Focus on the best channels</h3>
<p>Acclaimed management author Peter Drucker wrote, &quot;When you focus on your strengths, you make weaknesses irrelevant.&quot; The same idea applies to online profiles you choose to cultivate.</p>
<p><strong>Unless you're managing social media full-time, You should ruthlessly de-prioritize every profile except your top 1-2 accounts.</strong></p>
<p>This forces you to maximize your results from your channels with the best chances to succeed, while cutting out channels that would otherwise suck hours out of your busy week.  </p>
<h2>Step 4: Use smart guessing to create a new game plan</h2>
<p>You've identified the best channels for success and witnessed examples of successful competitors in your indsutry. Next, it's time to capitalize on the opportunities you've identified.</p>
<h3>Create 2-3 hypotheses for your top channels</h3>
<p>What is a hypothesis? You may remember from science class that it's a simple formula for testing your ideas against your expected results.</p>
<p>Usually, it follows a formula similar to <a href="http://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/2010/02/a-strong-hypothesis.php">this</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If <strong><strong><em>[I do this] </em></strong></strong>, then <strong><strong><em>[this]</em></strong></strong> will happen.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're going to create an educated guess based on the data you collected about your profiles and strategies you've identified from your competitors.</p>
<p>Make sure your hypothesis uses SMART goals to stay actionable and grounded in reality.</p>
<p>SMART goals follow <a href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php">this framework</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S - specific, significant, stretching</p>
<p>M - measurable, meaningful, motivational</p>
<p>A - agreed upon, attainable, achievable, acceptable, action-oriented</p>
<p>R - realistic, relevant, reasonable, rewarding, results-oriented</p>
<p>T - time-based, time-bound, timely, tangible, trackable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, here's one of my recent hypotheses using SMART goal-setting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I post 3 videos to the McMahon Marketing Facebook page every week in January, then organic post engagement will increase by 25% over December posts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, you'll need to set a date to evaluate your hypothesis and make adjustments moving forward.</p>
<p>Take the following steps to make sure you stay on top of your new strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mark a specific time out to evaluate the past time period on your calendar. (I recommend 2 weeks to start.)</li>
<li>Write down the actual results of your hypothesis in action and compare them to what you expected.</li>
<li>Use your new information to shift your strategy to focus on new content, audience needs, or platforms. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Taking the time to analyze your social media performance and make smart changes can pay huge dividends in the long-run. Not only </p>    ]]></content>
