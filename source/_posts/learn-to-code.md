I talked to a developer last week who has been teaching kids to code in an after school program.

His teaching secret?

Teach using this format: **Motivate > Set a Goal > Work through the problem together.**

## Keep It Simple & Move Fast
I think it's a helpful starting place when the big, scary idea of "CODING" seems intimidating.

Start by understanding **what** you want to change in the world and **why.** (Motivation!)

Set a concrete goal of a small feature / slice of an application that would solve a problem — even if it's small and silly. (That's a goal!)

Then chip off a small piece of your day to work toward your achievable goal as quickly as possible. Rinse & repeat.

It's not a bulletproof way to learn code. (I mean... Is there a "right" way to learn?) But, I think it's a useful framework for biting off a quick win when someone's just dipping their toes in the water.
