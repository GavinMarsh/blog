“Why do the rich keep getting richer?”


“Why do I not have any free money to invest in the stock, crypto or latest fad?”

“Why am I always skint, goddamn it?”

The fact of the matter is really wealthy individuals just think differently, they have a different belief system and apart from old money or an inherited trust fund it really is that simple.

The following articles are aimed at the new and novice investor or someone who is looking to build their capital base the correct way – for investors who are looking to make their fortune in the crypto space but are currently under capitalised.

I tend to see a lot of articles about the next big crypto ICO to invest in but no information on how someone is to create and build capital (stake) to invest in the first place.
